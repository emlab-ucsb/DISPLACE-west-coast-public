While swordfish is also common, its fishery is about to close, so we did not include it. These species also represent the highest landings by weight and value (though sablefish prices have recently dropped). Although crab and squid have the highest overall landings, they are primarily caught nearshore and are therefore not impacted by the leases. The fisheries of this species is also known ans DTS (Deepwater Trawl complex Species)."

Most of the data is extracted from the stock assessments approved by the Pacific Fishery Management Council during the September 2023 Council Meeting.\nBesides specific parameter values for each species, detailed in the subsequent sections, the following variables are also included in Stock_biological_traits.csv:\n\nUseIt: values Yes/No, indicating whether it is included in the analysis or not.\nstock: code of the population. For our study case this corresponds to the FAO code.\nspecies: Species scientific name.\nSource_Biology and Source_Stock: references from where the values are taken.\n\nStock_biological_traits.csv also contains details on the input size bins in DISPLACE, as defined in Stock_abundances_at_szgroup.csv.Using the maximum length values across all DTS species, we set a sz_bin_cm of 6 (in cm) based on the unit_sizebin, where a value of 1 is used. For more details, refer to the section on abundance by size.\n\n1.2.1 Sablefish\n(Anoplopoma fimbria) (FAO code SAB)\n\nNote: For cases with sexual dimorphism, the average value across both females and males is used.\n\n1.2.1.1 Somatic growth\n\nLinf: Asymptotic length. Sablefish stock assessments assumes Schnute growth rather than von Bertalanffy growth. Since DISPLACE does not incorporate Schnute, we will derive Bertalanffy parameters from those in Schnute.\nThe von Bertalanffy growth function is given by the folowwing expression:\n\n\\[\nL(t)=L_∞(1−e^{−K(t−t_0)})\n\\]\nThe four-parameter growth function from Schnute can be defined as:\n\\[\nL(t) =  L_1 + \\left( L_2 - L_1 \\right) \\frac{1 - e^{-K(t - t_1)}}{1 - e^{-K(t_2 - t_1)}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Schnute and von Bertalanffy growth parameters for Sablefish.\n\n\nParameter\nValue\n\n\n\n\nLength-at-age min (female)\n25.262\n\n\nLength-at-age max (female)\n61.130\n\n\nvon Bertalanffy K (female)\n0.367\n\n\nLength-at-age min (male)\n26.621\n\n\nLength-at-age max (male)\n56.111\n\n\nvon Bertalanffy K (male)\n0.381\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can get \\(L_2\\) from Length-at-age max (female) is 61.130 and (male) 56.111, and \\(L_1\\) from Length-at-age max (female) is 25.262 and (male) 26.621 in page 27, table 2 (Johnson, Wetzel, and Tolimieri (2023)). Further, \\(K\\) corresponds to 0.367 \\(yr^{-1}\\) for females and 0.381 \\(yr^{-1}\\) for males from page 10 and from von Bertalanffy K variables in page 27, table 2 (Johnson, Wetzel, and Tolimieri (2023)) (Table 1.1). Regarding \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\), these can be found on the benchmark assessment M. A. Haltuch et al. (2019), section 3.3, page 54, on general model specifications, corresponding to 0.5 and 30 years respectively.\nIf we derive LInf from Schnute we get:\n\\[\nL_{\\infty} = \\frac{L_2 - L_1 \\cdot e^{-K(t_2 - t_1)}}{1 - e^{-K(t_2 - t_1)}}\n\\]\nBased on the parameters available in the assessment, we will calculate Linf independently for males and females. The average value across both will be inputted into DISPLACE and corresponds to 58.6210501.\nAlternatively, if the values from the stock assessment could not be derived, we could have considered using the value of 63.67 cm from Table 6 in M. A. Head, Keller, and Bradburn (2014) publication. However, we are including these here merely as a reference.\n\nCV_Linf: We only have Schnute parameters available. In this case, we will use the average of the Growth CV old values, as they are the closest to Linf and can serve as a proxy. These correspond to Growth CV old (female) (0.103) and (male) (0.078) in page 27, table 2 (Johnson, Wetzel, and Tolimieri (2023)). Mean value used 0.0905.\nK: Von Bertalanffy \\(K\\). 0.367 \\(yr^{-1}\\) for females and 0.381 \\(yr^{-1}\\) for males from page 10 and from von Bertalanffy K variables in page 27, table 2 (Johnson, Wetzel, and Tolimieri (2023)). Mean value used 0.374 \\(yr^{-1}\\).\nt0: Theoretical age of the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) at which fish would have a size of zero. Again, we need to consider that the stock assessment express growth using Schnute parameters. Thus we’ll need to derive \\(t_0\\) from:\n\n\\[\nt_0 = t_1 + \\frac{1}{K} \\ln \\left( \\frac{L_2 - L_1}{L_2 - L_1 \\cdot e^{-K(t_2 - t_1)}} \\right)\n\\]\nThis yields a t0 of -1.1883843, which we will use. For reference, Table 7 from M. A. Head, Keller, and Bradburn (2014) provides an overall estimate of -1.28 years. TO DISCUSS\n\nCV_recru: Coefficient of variation in recruitment. Table 2, on page 27 from the stock assessment, includes all model parameters. Among others, it defines recruitment variability (\\(\\sigma R\\)), which corresponds to the standard deviation of the log-scale recruitment deviations (Johnson, Wetzel, and Tolimieri (2023)). Then the coefficient of variation (CV) of recruitment can be estimated from this parameter as follows:\n\n\\[\nCV = \\sqrt{ \\exp(\\sigma R^2) - 1 }\n\\]\nThus, for \\(\\sigma R = 1.4\\), the CV will be 2.4696816.\n\n\n1.2.1.2 Length-weight relationship\nLength-weight relationship expression: \\(W = aL^b\\)\n\na: Weight-length coefficient. Female 3.315e-06 and male 3.371e-06 from table 11 (M. Haltuch et al. (2019)). Mean value used 3.343^{-6}.\nb: Weight-length exponent. Female 3.27264 and male 3.27008 from table 11 (M. Haltuch et al. (2019)). Mean value used 3.27136.\n\n\n\n1.2.1.3 Maturity\n\nL50: Length 50% mature. Overall value of 54.64 cm (used in Marlin) from all geographic areas and depths combined from Table 3 (M. A. Head, Keller, and Bradburn (2014)). Alternative value of 55.190 from table 11 (M. Haltuch et al. (2019)). Both values correspond to female lengths. We will use the average from both assessments.\nTo determine the male’s L50, we can use the proportion of L50 to Linf observed in females. Given that the female Linf is 61.130 cm and the female L50 is 54.915 cm (from the average of the available values), we first calculate the proportion of L50to Linf for females (0.8983314). We then apply this same proportion to the male Linf (56.111 cm) to find the male L50 (50.4062746cm). We will use the mean value between female and the calcualted male lengths 52.6606373 cm. (This value is also given to the DISPLACE parameter mat).\nmat_cat: This corresponds to the maturity size DISPLACE category at the L50. Given 0:13 bins and a sz_bin_cm of 6, as defined earlier, the corresponding bin index for an L50 of 52.6606373 cm is 9.\nNOTE: Bastardie described it with the following example: if there are 5 cm bins (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and the L50 maturity size is 14 cm, then the mat_cat should be 3. However, this raises the question: does mat_cat = 3 correspond to the third bin (index 2 in zero-based indexing)? Or should it instead be recoded to 2 to consider initial value of zero?\nr_age: Age of recruitment. (Not used in DISPLACE, but included in the input files as a reference). As a reference here we will use A50, having a value of 6.86 from table 5 (M. A. Head, Keller, and Bradburn (2014)) and a value of 5 from Guzmán et al. (2017), yielding an average value of 5.93, corresponding to the one used in Marlin. We should note that Guzmán et al. (2017) value is not based on their own data but on two outdated paper estimates (Fujiwara and Hankin (1988) and Parks and Shaw (1987)). Alternatively we could also use Rodgveller, Stark, and Echave (2016) values from table 2, although these are specific from Alaska populations. Since DISPLACE does not require this parameter, we will exclusively reference that from M. A. Head, Keller, and Bradburn (2014).\nNote: Despite not being used for DISPLACE parametrization, the parameter is read and it is used within GeneratePopulationsFeatures.R. High values trigger Error in As[r_age + 1, ] : subscript out of bounds associated to line 552 of the R routine. Thus we will specify NA and no A50 value as a reference. Need to confirm with Bastardie whether this is actually affecting the parametrization.\nssb_assessment: Total weight of the sexually mature (i.e., capable of reproduction) part of a fish population. Spawning Stock Biomass in mT from page 38, table 4 (Johnson, Wetzel, and Tolimieri (2023)). DISPLACE does not allow to include different SSB by year simulated. Instead we can choose values from one year or an average value across simulated years. For our analysis we will use that from the year 2010, when our simulation starts (86995 mT). (Not used in DISPLACE, but included in the input files as a reference)\n\n\n\n1.2.1.4 Recruitment\n\n1.2.1.4.1 alpha & beta\n\nalpha and beta: Parameters from the Ricker recruitment model. The available stock assessments for DTS use the Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship. While Beverton-Holt can be expressed in terms of alpha and beta, our stock assessments use the steepness formulation. Thus, we need to transform our expressions to:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{\\alpha S}{1 + \\beta S}\n\\]\nThe parameters are given by:\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{5h-1}{4hR_0} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\alpha = SPR_0 \\left(\\frac{1-h}{4h}\\right)\n\\]\nThus we can calculate alpha and beta from \\(h\\) (steepness), \\(R_0\\) (recruitment at unfished equilibrium), and \\(SPR_0\\) (spawning potential ratio at unfished equilibrium).\n\n\\(h\\): steepness is 0.7, as described in the model parameters section 3.2.7, page 9 (Johnson, Wetzel, and Tolimieri (2023)).\n\\(R_0\\): value 19453.9 from at table 10 (Johnson, Wetzel, and Tolimieri (2023)).\n\\(SPR_0\\): In Table 10 we can find several SPR values, but none for the unfished equilibrium (Johnson, Wetzel, and Tolimieri (2023)). MISSING\n\n\n\n1.2.1.4.2 Fixed recruitment\n\nfixed recruitment:\nIn the meantime, while we are unable to define the Beverton-Holt relationship using alpha and beta, we will set a fixed recruitment. The model type can be specified in files like 0spe_SSB_R_parameters_biolsce1.dat, where the first value represents alpha, followed by beta and CV_recru. The last value determines the recruitment model to use: 0 for Ricker, 1 for Beverton-Holt, and 2 for fixed recruitment. To apply fixed recruitment (code 2), alpha should specify the number of recruits in thousands, while beta is set to 0.\nFor example, in the input file for population 0 (e.g., 0spe_SSB_R_parameters_biolsce1.dat), the configuration could consist of three rows (excluding CV_recru), with values: 72585, 0 and 2. This setup instructs DISPLACE to assign a fixed recruitment of 72585*1000 individuals at the start of each year (\\(y\\)) for population 0.\nDespite Sablefish recruitment being estimated to have been quite variable, with large amounts of uncertainty in individual recruitment events as seen in Table iii from Johnson, Wetzel, and Tolimieri (2023) (Table 1.2), we will use, as a first approximation, the mean value from the time series recruitment (5.0930741^{4} in thousands), while we await to define BH parameters to define recruitment within the model.\nThe DISPLACE R routines are set to write the {pop_code}spe_SSB_R_parameters_biolsce{q}.dat file using either the Ricker or Beverton-Holt (BH) structures. We will generate the file contents for each population and store them in the DISPLACE_raw_inputs/{project-name}/POPULATIONS directory. From these, the respective files will be updated when running GeneratePopulationsFeatures.R (update in line 748).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.2: Estimated recent trend in recruitment (1,000s) for Sablefish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\n2013.0\n2014.00\n2015.0\n2016.0\n2017.0\n2018.00\n2019.0\n2020\n2021\n2022.00\n2023.0\n\n\nrecruitment_1000s\n37796.8\n7268.36\n27643.7\n66059.4\n13137.7\n3955.65\n13835.9\n154839\n208277\n9122.34\n18302.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.1.5 Management\n\nFMSY: Fishing mortality rate that produces the maximum sustainable yield. Given the information available in the stock assessments, and as done in other publications, we could use the Exploitation Rate Corresponding to SPR MSY as proxy of FMSY. We can get this value from page xii, table v (Johnson, Wetzel, and Tolimieri (2023)). The Exploitation Rate Corresponding to SPR MSY, and lower and upper intervals are 0.069, 0.057 and 0.082, respectively. These values will be assigned to FMSY, FMSYlower and FMSYupper, DISPLACE parameters. (This value is also given to F_target).\nB_trigger: The biomass trigger is a reference point that initiates specific management actions when the biomass of a fish stock falls below or exceeds a certain threshold. Currently, a trigger of 40%* for groundfish and 25% for flatfish (including Dover sole) is used. When biomass falls below these thresholds, a fishing mortality rate more conservative than FMSY is applied. However, we still need to define how DISPLACE captures this and determine which mortality rate applies under such events. Additionally, it is important to define the units used—whether as a percentage or in per one format. Pending further discussion with Bastardie, we will include no management triggers (B_trigger = 0). TO DISCUSS\nmls and mls_cat: minimum landing size (the smallest legal size at which a fish can be caught, kept, and sold) and the corresponding DISPLACE size category. There is no minimum individual size for DTS. Thus both values will be 0.\ntac_tons: Total Allowable Catch. It represents the maximum quantity of fish that can be legally harvested from a particular fishery over a specified period. For the U.S. fisheries management system this parameter corresponds to the Annual Catch Limit (ACL). We can get ACL from the Groundfish biennial harvest specifications and management measures of the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Pacific Fishery Management Council (2022), Pacific Fishery Management Council (2020), Pacific Fishery Management Council (2016)).\nDifferent ACL (mT) values are defined for each year as shown in Table 1.3. For some of our species of interest, there are also distinct values depending on the zones split by a specific latitude. For simplicity, we will aggregate these values to obtain a unique TAC estimate without distinguishing by zone. Since DISPLACE does not allow changes to values across years simulated, we will use an average value across multiple years.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.3: Catch allocation for commercial fishing based.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock_Complex\nArea\nACL_2017\nACL_2018\nACL_2019\nACL_2020\nACL_2021\nACL_2022\nACL_2023\nACL_2024\n\n\n\n\nDover Sole\nCW\n50000\n50000\n50000\n50000\n50000\n50000\n50000\n50000\n\n\nLongspine Thornyhead\nN of 34°27’\n2894\n2747\n2603\n2470\n2634\n2452\n2295\n2162\n\n\nLongspine Thornyhead\nS of 34°27’\n914\n867\n822\n780\n832\n774\n725\n683\n\n\nShortspine Thornyhead\nN of 34°27’\n1713\n1698\n1683\n1669\n1428\n1393\n1359\n1328\n\n\nShortspine Thornyhead\nS of 34°27’\n906\n898\n890\n883\n756\n737\n719\n702\n\n\nSablefish\nN of 36°\n6041\n6299\n5606\n5723\n6479\n6172\n8486\n7780\n\n\nSablefish\nS of 36°\n1075\n1120\n1990\n2032\n2312\n2203\n2338\n2143\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData available at:\n\nGroundfish Harvest Specifications and Management Measures for 2023-2024 (including Amendment 30).

In other words, TAC in year $year_{y+1} $ cannot differ by more than \\(XX\\%\\) of TAC in year $year_y $. Using the ACL values from above, we calculate an average year-to-year change of 5.4688129%. Values within Stock_biological_traits.csv are expressed in per one. (This value is also applied to F_percent).

The available assessments do not estimate any values of fishing mortality. Alternatively, we could use relative fishing intensity or exploitation rate as a proxy. Table iv from Johnson, Wetzel, and Tolimieri (2023) contains exploitation rate time series, which we can average to get our estimate of interest. Exploitation rate is just a slightly different conceptualization of fishing mortality. It represents a proportion rather than a rate. By averaging the exploitation rates (Table 1.4), we get an fbar_assessment value of 0.0208.

The recruitment estimates seem too low compared to the others. Could it be that these values are actually expressed in thousands, and this is just a typo in the report? Actually, in both cases the figures of estimated time series of age-0 recruits are expressed in 1000s. I’ve already come across other typos, such as the length-weight relationship units, before.

    "section": "2.1 Fisheries",
    "text": "2.1 Fisheries\nThis section includes a description of the raw input datasets and the parameters considered to run the R routines related to the fisheries characteristics, including information on individual fishing vessels, gears, metiers, economics of the vessels, etc. These files should be stored and loaded from DISPLACE_raw_inputs/{project-name}/FISHERIES.\nSuch information is derived from available VMS, fish ticket (fishtix), and vessel registry data, through which we define the vessel parameters required to run DISPLACE. VMS data was obtained from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and is not publicly available. With the exception of vessel registry data—sourced from open sources—VMS and fishtix data are stored outside our cloud and repository infrastructure to comply with data sharing agreements (You’ll need to have this data locally in order to run it).\nAs for the data represented, no confidential data is displayed, and all information is aggregated to comply with the rule of three.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Vessels specifications\nThe DISPLACE input file vessels_specifications_per_harbour_metiers.csv contains information on individual or grouped vessel characteristics by harbor and metier (i.e., each vessel could be repeated more than once in this table if it belongs to more than one metier or lands in different ports). Métier is defined as a combination of gear and target species or fisheries that are distinctly defined.\nThe variables included in this dataset are detailed below and are referenced within the generate_vessels_specifications function in r/functions_fe.R:\n\nVesselId: This variable corresponds to the vessel IDs. This could represent VMS ID, IMO number, or any other identification value with which we can distinguish individual vessels or grouped vessels. In our case, we use the vessel documentation number (docnum) extracted from VMS data, which corresponds to the primary Vessel Number in USCG datasets and the Vessel Registration Number in NOAA datasets, as a reference code to identify vessels. However, the DISPLACE nomenclature for vessel IDs consists of the country code followed by a numeric code (e.g., USA0001, USA0002, etc.). Therefore, we have recoded all docnum values to align with it and stored a mapping key for future reference.\nnb_vessels: This is the number of vessels represented by a unique ID. If we have information on all vessels available, this will have a value of 1. If we have limited information at an individual vessel level or want to simplify the analysis, we can group several vessels under the same ID and fisheries characteristics and specify here the number of vessels in each group.\n\n\nPort: This is the port from where the vessels operate, or ports where they land the catches. If a vessel operates in more than one port, we should create two distinct observations for that vessel, distinguishing between one harbor and another. For this study case, we are including only vessels operating from ports with high landing of the species of interest.\nTo determine such ports, we have evaluated which ports receive the highest landings of the 4 species of interest based on the vms-fishtix merge data. As seen in Table 2.1, if we select those ports with at least 2% of landings, this reduces the number of ports for analysis to 7 harbors out of 45 available in the vms-tix dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Harbours in california with the higher amount of landings.

For European fisheries, the DCF relates to metiers defined using Data Collection Framework (DCF) datasets. However, here we can define any metier by vessel length, gear, species mix, or any other criteria, based on any dataset not necessarily spatially defined. For our case study, we’ll define them using the declaration codes from VMS data. Wang et al. (2024) publication includes the declaration codes detailed below, among which we are interested in c(210, 211, 230, 231, 233, 234, 235).\nWe are temporarily using declaration codes instead of specific gear, following the methods outlined by Wang et al. (2024). The selection of declaration codes is based on the gears of interest, which are grouped within the above declaration codes. However, we expect to receive a NOAA VMS and fish ticket merged dataset that will allow us to define gear more specifically, rather than relying on declaration codes. The gears we are interested in, which are the only ones used for our species of interest, are: SET LONGLINE, HOOK & LINE, VERTICAL HOOK & LINE/PORTUGUESE LONGLINE, TROLL (GROUNDFISH OR OTHER FISH), FISH TRAP, TRAWL - FOOTROPE GREATER THAN 8 INCHES IN DIAMETER, SELECTIVE FLATFISH TRAWL SMALL FOOTROPE, TRAWL - FOOTROPE LESS THAN 8 INCHES IN DIAMETER, MIDWATER TRAWL, SINGLE-RIGGED TRAWL, PAIR TRAWL, and BOTTOM TRAWL.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.3: Declaration Codes Included in Wang et al. publication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecl.\nDescription (dominant gear types)\n\n\n\n\n210\nLimited entry fixed gear not including shorebased IFQ (pots/traps, bottom longline, longline, hook and line)\n\n\n211\nLimited entry groundfish non-trawl shorebased IFQ (pots/traps, bottom longline, longline, hook and line)\n\n\n220\nLimited entry midwater trawl gear non-whiting shorebased IFQ (midwater trawl for species other than whiting)\n\n\n221\nLimited entry midwater trawl Pacific whiting shorebased IFQ (midwater trawl for whiting)\n\n\n222\nLimited entry midwater trawl Pacific whiting catcher-processor sector (midwater trawl for whiting)\n\n\n223\nLimited entry midwater trawl Pacific whiting mothership sector; catcher vessel or mothership (midwater trawl for whiting)\n\n\n230\nLimited entry bottom trawl shorebased IFQ not including demersal trawl\n\n\n231\nLimited entry demersal trawl shorebased IFQ\n\n\n233\nOpen access longline gear for groundfish\n\n\n234\nOpen access groundfish trap or pot gear\n\n\n235\nOpen access line gear for groundfish\n\n\n240\nNon-groundfish trawl gear for ridgeback prawn\n\n\n241\nNon-groundfish trawl gear for pink shrimp\n\n\n242\nNon-groundfish trawl gear for California halibut\n\n\n243\nNon-groundfish trawl gear for sea cucumber\n\n\n250\nTribal trawl gear\n\n\n260\nOpen access prawn trap or pot gear\n\n\n261\nOpen access Dungeness crab trap or pot gear\n\n\n262\nOpen access Pacific Halibut longline gear\n\n\n263\nOpen access salmon troll gear\n\n\n264\nOpen access California halibut line gear\n\n\n265\nOpen access sheephead trap or pot gear\n\n\n266\nOpen access Highly Migratory Species line gear\n\n\n267\nOpen access Coastal Pelagic Species net gear\n\n\n268\nOpen access California gillnet complex gear\n\n\n269\nA gear that is not listed above\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGear: Despite the name of the variable, this field does not contain the actual gear used by the vessel but rather the name of the .shp file that spatially defines the fishing effort for that specific gear or gear group. These spatial files must be available inside DISPLACE_raw_inputs/{project-name}/FISHERIES/SpatialLayers. In this analysis, we used declaration codes from VMS rather than the gear information available in the fish tickets. Therefore, this analysis relies on the gear information and fishing distribution associated with each declaration code indicated in variable dcf_gear.\nTo define effort distributions, we applied the methodology used to generate the effort maps from Wang et al. (2024) on the VMS-tix merged data by declaration codes and filtering values for our target species. Additionally, we accounted only for vessels operating from our harbors of interest.\nFor the declaration codes of interest, we generated a fishing effort density map for each except for declaration code 231, for which we follow a similar approach to that taken by Wang et al. (2024), and aggregate with declaration code 230 (both related to trawl) since the former had very low overall fishing effort. Thus, 6 different Gear levels were defined to represent the métiers included in this analysis. These levels were assigned by matching the file names with the relevant declaration codes or combinations of codes, specifying whether the vessel in question is involved in that fishery. These spatial layers were saved as DISPLACE inputs in shp format.\nThe values from Wang et al. (2024) are expressed in \\(km/km^2/year\\). However, DISPLACE outputs represent fishing effort as cumulative fishing time in hours. To allow comparison with the DISPLACE outputs, we have adapted the methods described in Wang et al. (2024). Additionally, DISPLACE uses this fishing distribution to assess the probability that a simulated fishing vessel will fish at a given node. In discussions with Bastardie, we assessed the need to input such FE distributions in probability units. However, after testing the R routines with two different FE shapefile inputs—one based on cumulative times and the other on probabilities—we found that both approaches, given their identical distributions, produce nearly identical vesselsspe_freq_fgrounds_quarter1.dat files—the ones read by DISPLACE defining fishing probabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Fishing effort distribution by declaration code from 2010-2017 (probability of fishing). Filtered by species of interest. Cells visited by three or fewer vessels are not displayed to comply with the rule of three.\n\n\n\n\n\nVE_LEN and Tonnage: These parameters correspond to vessel length (m) and vessel tonnage (any unit).Tonnage values are not used as DISPLACE inputs, but included as a references. Further, we use tonnage values to extrapolate other parameters such as engine power or fuel tank capacity. Neither the VMS nor fish ticket data contain much information on vessel characteristics. To obtain such information, we have created two separate web scraping scripts in Python, available at python/vessel_info_scraping.ipynb. These scripts mine information from the USCG Port State Information Exchange website and the NOAA limited entry dataset. While the latter downloads the entire available dataset, the former extracts information for a given list of vessels of interest. Therefore, to run it, we must create a list of vessels of interest (vessels_oi.csv), in our case, the ones included in the vessel specification files that we are generating.\nIn addition to vessel length information, the data from USCG contains information for tonnage, both in net tons or gross tons. We will use the latter as it is the common size measure used by IMO.\nFor any missing length data, we can use the NOAA and ODFW dataset to supplement the information. Then for any additional missing values we will extrapolate length and tonnage values out of average values based on the available information.\nname_gis_file_for_fishing_effort_per_polygon: the same file name indicated in Gear representing spatial effort by gear. In our case, these are fe_code_235, fe_code_233, fe_code_230_231, fe_code_234, fe_code_210, fe_code_211.\nname_gis_layer_field: parameter defining the variable in .shp expressing the fishing effort, in our case fe. The units are not important since it can be interpreted in relative terms depending on what we specify in variable is_gis_layer_field_relative_numbers.\nis_gis_layer_field_relative_numbers: Here we indicate whether the effort variable represents relative values or not. The default value is FALSE. Regarding the implications of using effort distribution expressed in relative terms, the GIS layer per metier is used to draw some probabilities for the vessel on specific fishing grounds defined by each metier. R routines should be adapted in that aspect to incorporate the contents of the shapefile.\nIf relative values are available, you can still use the R routines designed for absolute values. Simply adjust the GIS layer to reflect the relative importance on a linear scale. For example, if some areas are 100 times more likely to be visited than others, assign a value of 1 to the less frequented polygon and 100 to the more frequented one.\nUnits available from Wang et al. (2024) are in \\(km/km^2/year\\). However, DISPLACE outputs express fishing effort as cumulative fishing time in hours. Therefore, we have adapted Wang et al. (2024) methods to allow for comparison with the DISPLACE outputs.\nxfold_gis_layer_field: unknown. Default value 1.\nNOTE: Bastardier mentioned that if we do the trick suggested above relative to the relative units, then we don’t need this term. What value should we assign to it if we don’t need it, 0? We should further clarify this parameter and see the implications of using effort expressed in km/km²/yr.\n{population code}_kg_h: This variable defines the catching capacity per fishing hour of a vessel or group of vessels for each population included in our analysis. Each population will have its own variable. For instance, our analysis includes SAB_kg_h, SJU_kg_h, SJZ_kg_h, and MIP_kg_h. This can be understood as a measure of CPUE for each individual vessel. However, it is primarily used in the simulation to define the rate of fishing and determine how much time is required to fill the storage capacity of each vessel.\nmean_kW: Mean engine power. The only reliable dataset with engine power is the one shared by the ODFW. However, this is not complete and most of our vessels of interest are missing. The second dataset we could use is a GFW dataset of vessel metadata. However, the ID numbers for our vessels of interest do not match the ones used in the GFW dataset (SSVID and IMO), so we cannot merge the tables. For this reason, for those that can not be assigned using ODFW data, we will use vessels information from the GFW dataset with similar characteristics to ours to define a simple regression and establish an expression that allows us to estimate engine power from length and gear type.\nThe regression defines engine power as a function of vessel length, tonnage, and fishing class. While length and tonnage can be directly applied to our vessels_specifications dataframe, the fishing classes used by GFW differ from ours. Therefore, we have established a mapping based on gear to relate the declaration codes with GFW fishing classes. Based on the descriptions from Table 2.3 and by evaluating the gear_name and declarations variables from the VMS-tix data, we have established the mapping in tbl-class-mapping. For vessels associated with more than one class, the engine power is assigned based on the average mean_kW value across the classes to which they are assigned. Further, no predicted value will be lower than the minimum engine power from the dataset used to fit the model.\nThis is a first approximation. The initial results show poor adjustments. We aim to obtain specific real data for each vessel. Alternatively, we will need to improve this approach. More vessel metadata including engine power can be find in the [iattc vessel registry](https://www.iattc.org/en-US/Management/Vessel-register?shortcut=RegionalVR#United%20States and the EU fleet registry\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.4: Mapping used to assign GFW class to our vessels.\n\n\ncode\ngear_type\n\n\n\n\n210\nset_longlines\n\n\n211\npots_and_traps\n\n\n230\ntrawlers\n\n\n231\ntrawlers\n\n\n233\nset_longlines\n\n\n234\npots_and_traps\n\n\n235\nset_longlines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfishing.speed.knots and cruise.speed.knots: Average speed when the vessel is fishing and average speed when the vessel is cruising. We can get these values from the VMS data by discriminating fishing pings from the rest using fishingornot variable.\nfuel.tank.liter: Correspond to fuel tank capacity. This parameters is quite important because it influence the trip duration. A half-empty fuel tank will trigger the vessel to return to port, assuming half of the fuel is used to go back (other reasons for returning to port include a full fish hold, or at the end of a day if your vessel is set to do daily trips, i.e., when trip duration is set to &lt;30h).\nThere are no datasets available that allow us to match our vessel ids with tank capacity data. To establish fuel.tank.liter, we have opted to fit a polynomial model that allows us to get estimates of fuel tank capacity (Figure 2.2). The few data available was scraped from a broker’s website selling fishing vessels in the USA. The web scraping scripts are available in python/vessel_info_scraping.ipynb, and allowed to access data for 116 fishing vessels. The only variable across our vessels’ characteristics and this dataset that we could use to fit a model and predict estimates for our vessels was vessel length. As with the assignment of engine power, no predicted value for tank capacity will be lower than the minimum tank capacity from the dataset used to fit the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Fuel tank capacity (liters) vs vessel length (meters).\n\n\n\n\n\nfuel.cons.h: Corresponds to fuel consumption per hour. As with fuel.tank.liter, this parameter is also quite important because it determines the trip duration. It conditions the fuel availability, triggering a port return when the fuel tank is half-empty, assuming that given the consumption levels in different operational phases, half or more of the remaining fuel is used to go back. For this parameter, we will temporarily use the consumption expression from Bastardie et al. (2013). Improved methods can be used, but for preliminary analysis purposes, this will suffice. This expression defines fuel consumption per hour based on engine power in kW and a multiplier adjusted for different operational phases, which will be defined under the variables multip.fuel.steaming, multip.fuel.fishing, multip.fuel.ret.port.fish, and multip.fuel.inactive.\nfuel.cons.h values need to be reviewed. Better approaches for establishing such consumption levels are available in the literature and should be considered for the final analysis.\n\n\nOperational phase multipliers: These are multipliers on the fuel consumption per hour depending on the phases of a trip, as fuel consumption can vary during these phases.\nmultip.fuel.steaming: This multiplier adjusts the fuel consumption rate when the vessel is steaming, typically referring to traveling to or from fishing grounds.\nmultip.fuel.fishing: This multiplier adjusts the fuel consumption rate when the vessel is actively fishing. Fuel consumption during fishing can vary depending on the type of fishing gear used and the fishing methods employed.\nmultip.fuel.ret.port.fish: This multiplier adjusts the fuel consumption rate when the vessel is returning to port with its catch. The vessel might carry extra weight due to the fish caught, which could increase fuel consumption.\nmultip.fuel.inactive: This multiplier adjusts the fuel consumption rate when the vessel is inactive, such as when it is docked at port or anchored at sea. During this phase, the vessel would consume less fuel compared to active operations. It is also used for gillnetters setting nets at very low speeds, thus decreasing fuel consumption.\nIn the absence of specific information, you can set all these multipliers to 1. However, for our preliminary analysis, we will use the values from Bastardie et al. (2013), with values of 1, 0.8, and 0.1 for the fishing, steaming, and inactive states, respectively. For fuel consumption when returning to port, we will use a value of 1.1, also used in other DISPLACE analyses from the Bastardie repository, as it slightly increases fuel consumption when the vessel is returning to port carrying all the catch.\nave.storage.fish.kg: Fish storage capacity. This is the vessel’s carrying capacity, which is defined as the best observed historical catches for such a vessel. This creates a somewhat artificial ceiling for total catches. It is used to trigger a return to port. We will calculate it using fish ticket data.\nnb_pings_per_trip: This defines the frequency of changing fishing grounds within a trip. If this number is greater than 1, the vessel may shift between several fishing grounds instead of fishing in just one area. For instance, if the value is 1, the vessel will fish only in a single location and won’t switch grounds while fishing, which reduces navigation time between fishing areas. Higher values might result in larger times at sea as vessels switch more constantly between distant fishing grounds. After several testing simulations, we have set this parameter to 1. This means that a vessel will fish on a single ground during a trip, without switching to a different ground, which would result in longer navigation times. By doing so, we achieved a fishing distribution that closely resembles the one described by Wang et al. (2024).\ntrip.duration.h: Average trip duration per metier. This affects the times at sea in the simulation. We can test the effects if using maximum trip duration instead. Also, consider that when calculating, we’ll only group by vesselid and not by port and gear, since we are assuming this relates to the average trip duration capacity of a vessel regardless of the type of fishing it is participating in.\nGamma_shape and Gamma_scale: These parameters are set to draw a time to rest in port between consecutive trips. The latest DISPLACE usage by the Basterie team is not using such parameters but rather the GoFishing decision tree, which will be covered in other sections. The default values are 0.4485 and 336.7618, respectively, which won’t be used if the GoFishing decision tree is active.\nweekEndStartDay, WeekEndEndDay, WorkHoursStart, WorkHoursEnd: These variables can be used in the decision tree for stopFishing if a decision tree is provided in the dtree folder. In the absence of such a tree, the return to port event is triggered by conditions such as a half-empty fuel tank, full fish holds, or the end of a daily trip (if the vessel’s specifications indicate a trip duration of less than 30 hours). Therefore, the trip duration can be flexible, lasting more than a week and not necessarily following a regular pattern. For week days a number of the week (1:7), for hours (1:24).\nvessel_range_km: Vessel range in kilometers, which defines how far a vessel can travel. Within the R routines, this parameter defines to which nodes an individual vessel has access to. Nodes outside that range, can not be visited. Currently, we calculate this by determining the maximum distance traveled among all trips and dividing it by 2 (round trip). Alternatively, we could reassess this by calculating the straight-line distance from the farthest point on a trip to the port, or the mean average distance travelled in each trip.\nNOTE: Any value above 4500 km yields an error in the R routines due to the straight-line issue mentioned above.\nRelativeEffort: A measure of individual fishing effort (i.e., how much effort is exerted by that vessel or group of vessels). For instance, if a vessel is represented for different metiers (i.e., more than one row in the dataframe), then this can exert different fishing effort in each metier, summing up the distinct relative efforts to 1. Thus, for a vessel represented in multiple rows (different metiers), we have calculated its contribution to each metier in relative terms based on time.\nkW: This is a redundant term and considered a useless legacy. The default value is NA.\n\n\n2.1.1.1 File overlook\nBelow is a sample of the vessels_specifications_per_harbour_metiers.csv input file, generated based on the above data (Table 2.5). Here we use made-up data for example purposes. Values do not reflect actual data.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.5: Sample of vessels_specifications_per_harbour_metiers.csv input file.

This platform provides access to metrics describing certain vessel economic characteristics and groundfish fisheries, with data aggregated by gear groups, harbors, or size classes. Access to more granular data, preferably at the vessel level, has been requested and is still under consideration. In the meantime, we have used mean values, first assigning them by ports where available, and for the remaining cases, using the available gear group data. For vessels operating with more than one gear or from more than one port, average values have been applied.\nThere are two files related to economic data describing individual vessels and fisheries. We do not have information for these two yet. (WORK IN PROGRESS)\n\nSTECF/Economics_fs.csv: Using default values from MEESO study. The values displayed do not reflect actual data from the West Coast or anywhere else in the United States.\n\nAnnual_depreciation_rate: the percentage by which an asset’s value decreases over the course of a year. It represents how much of the asset’s original cost is expensed as depreciation each year, based on its expected useful life.\nFrom the FISHEYE data, we can obtain both the vessel_market_value and vessel_replacement_value. Using these values, we could estimate the depreciation rate by calculating the percentage difference between the two. To estimate the annual depreciation rate, we would divide this percentage by the number of years from the vessel’s build year to the latest year for which FISHEYE provides information (i.e., 2022).\nNOTE: Confirm with Bastardie if this refers only to the vessel or also the gear. FISHEYE includes both vessel and gear in this estimates (Confirm). Also, confirm the units, whether in % or per one.\nAnnual_discount_rate: In 2023, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided guidance on discount rates through Circular A-94. The recommended discount rates remained consistent with previous years, with a 3% rate for projects involving public investments or intergenerational impacts. Therefore, we will use this value for our analysis.\nAnnual_insurance_costs_per_crew: variable Crew payments in FISHEYE include wages, bonuses, benefits, payroll taxes, and unemployment insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.6: Sample of the STECF/Economics_fs.csv input file.

Some of the issues previously observed are summarized in this section. These improvements have led to the current preliminary results, which still require further refinement.\nSome of the updates applied include:\n\nWe modified the species distribution files to display GRIDCODE values on a continuous scale rather than grouping them into five incremental categories, as done previously.\nWe updated the FE distributions from Wang et al. (2024) and removed the ‘rule of three’ filter, thereby extending the fishing distribution coverage. Although the FE distributions did not consider the rule of three when input into DISPLACE, the data displayed in this notebook has been filtered to show only cells with vessel presence above three ships to comply with data-sharing agreements. Further FE maps were modified to express effort as a probability of vessels going to a fishing ground.\nWe tested artificially increasing vessel parameters such as fuel tank capacity, storage capacity, and maximum navigation range, but this approach proved to be ineffective.\nWe explored different nb_pings settings. A value of 1 helped limit vessels from changing fishing grounds while fishing. However, this considerably narrowed the vessels’ distribution. Therefore, the current testing explores an nb_pings value of 2 while using different probabilities for vessels to change fishing grounds through ChangeGround Dtree.\nWe applied some restrictions to the data based on DTS fishery. Fishing day restrictions in the input data take into account that DTS represents only a small fraction of the fishing activity occurring from the vessels and ports assessed. To limit the number of trips matching those occuring for DTS species we made use of the GoFishing Dtree.\n\nAbout the data represented, no confidential data is displayed, and all information is aggregated to comply with the rule of three."

    "text": "3.4 Simulation issues detected\n\n3.4.1 Assessing distance navigated\nLarge navigation values were observed in the simulation when using a graph with varying node distances. By inspecting the vmslike_simu1.dat outputs, we identified that simulated vessels were navigating far from any fishing grounds, accumulating outside the 1st Inclusion Shapefile and in the first rows of nodes in the 2nd Inclusion Shapefile. We were unsure about the reasons causing this, but it could be resolved by using a single shapefile to define the graph with constant node distances more aligned with the FE and sp distribution input files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Low fisshing times\nAfter fixing the issue with the nodes and vessels navigating to the shapefiles borders, low fishing times persisted. Improvements in DISPLACE versions solved this. The following was tested under baseline scenario 5.0.\n\n3.4.2.1 Version 1.2.0\nVersion 1.2.0 had a bug causing a premature return to port. The issue was that the accumulated catches triggering the return to port were incorrectly calculated for all implicit populations, leading to sums larger than expected and triggering the return earlier than needed. Despite our populations being explicitly defined, this also impacted our simulation. This version yielded the following values:\n\nTotal cumulative fishing time from VMS-TIX: 270417.4.\nTotal cumulative fishing time from simulated trips: 12606.\n\n\nTotal landings from VMS-TIX: 30436950.\nTotal landings from simulated trips: 2913403.\n\n\nNumber of trips from VMS-TIX: 13784.\nNumber of simulated trips: 11874.\nTotal time at sea from VMS-TIX: 369500.1.\nTotal time at sea from simulation: 230196.\nTotal traveled distances from VMS-TIX: 2104922.\nTotal traveled distances from simulation: 3133639.\n\n\n\n3.4.2.2 Version 1.2.2\nVersion 1.2.2 fixed the previous issue and slightly increased fishing times and catch. However, lower fishing values persisted, as detailed below:\n\nTotal cumulative fishing time from VMS-TIX: 270417.4.\nTotal cumulative fishing time from simulated trips: 62089.\n\n\nTotal landings from VMS-TIX: 30436950.\nTotal landings from simulated trips: 22280157.\n\n\nNumber of trips from VMS-TIX: 13784.\nNumber of simulated trips: 11908.\nTotal time at sea from VMS-TIX: 369500.1.\nTotal time at sea from simulation: 463896.\nTotal traveled distances from VMS-TIX: 2104922.\nTotal traveled distances from simulation: 5805691.\n\nFrom the results above, it seemed that vessels spent less time fishing than they should have. One potential reason for the low fishing times was that vessels were returning to port prematurely. We explored this issue by inspecting the output file loglike.dat, specifically looking at reason_back (coded as: reason 1 for daily trip, reason 2 for fuel use, reason 3 for no storage left, and reason 4 for change of a quarter).\nAs seen in the tables below, the most common reason for simulated vessels to return to port is reason 4 (change of quarter). This accounts for 52% of all return trips, and 78% of vessels have this as their most frequent reason for returning.\n\n\n\n\n\nreason_back\nnumber_of_trips\npercentage\n\n\n\n\n1\n3185\n26.746725\n\n\n2\n1395\n11.714814\n\n\n3\n1038\n8.716829\n\n\n4\n6290\n52.821632\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreason_back\nnumber_of_vessels\npercentage\n\n\n\n\n1\n49\n17.132867\n\n\n2\n5\n1.748252\n\n\n3\n4\n1.398601\n\n\n4\n228\n79.720280\n\n\n\n\n\nThis could be due to the existence of lengthy trips that are likely to cross a change in quarter. We can assess whether this is happening by looking into the simulation steps involved in these returns. Using the tsteps in tstep_quarters.dat, which should indicate the start of new quarters, we checked whether any of these values fall within both tstep_dep and tstep_arr or match any of these from loglike.dat.\nAs seen in the following table for reason_back == 4, 97.1% of the trips do not occur across these quarter changes. This is surprising, as if the tsteps of any trip are not involved with a quarter change, this shouldn’t be the reason for vessels to return to port.\n\n\n\n\n\ntstep_in_range\nnumber_of_trips\npercentage\n\n\n\n\nFALSE\n6110\n97.138315\n\n\nTRUE\n180\n2.861685\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring further the issue of not getting enough fishing, we discovered that 59.7% of total trips had no catch. Among these, 86.8% of the no-catch trips returned to port due to the quarter ending. This means that 98.1% of trips with return code 4 had no catch. No catch also occurs for reason == 1 (daily trip), but this represents a lower percentage (&lt;30%). For the other two categories, no-catch events are around 0%.\nSo, something is clearly happening with reason 4 that is affecting fishing, or something happens with fishing that is triggering reason 4.\n\n\n\n\n\nno_catch\nnumber_of_trips\npercentage\n\n\n\n\nFALSE\n4794\n40.25865\n\n\nTRUE\n7114\n59.74135\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreason_back\nnumber_of_nocatch_trips\npercentage\n\n\n\n\n1\n940\n13.2133821\n\n\n2\n1\n0.0140568\n\n\n4\n6173\n86.7725611\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreason_back\nno_catch\nnumber_of_trips\npercentage\n\n\n\n\n1\nFALSE\n2245\n70.4866562\n\n\n1\nTRUE\n940\n29.5133438\n\n\n2\nFALSE\n1394\n99.9283154\n\n\n2\nTRUE\n1\n0.0716846\n\n\n3\nFALSE\n1038\n100.0000000\n\n\n4\nFALSE\n117\n1.8600954\n\n\n4\nTRUE\n6173\n98.1399046\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the reasons for this to happen might be driven by problems associated with gear types, as some fishing efforts are scattered, and perhaps some vessels traveled long distances to fishing grounds they never reached, resulting in no catch and long times at sea. However, when analyzing the results by metier, there doesn’t seem to be a significant predominance of any specific metier within trips with reason_back == 4. Similarly, the proportion of no-catch trips by metier doesn’t reveal any clear trends.\n\n\n\n\n\nno_catch\ngear\ntrips\npercentage\n\n\n\n\nFALSE\nfe_code_210\n1066\n22.236128\n\n\nFALSE\nfe_code_211\n248\n5.173133\n\n\nFALSE\nfe_code_230_231\n512\n10.680017\n\n\nFALSE\nfe_code_233\n1170\n24.405507\n\n\nFALSE\nfe_code_234\n1359\n28.347935\n\n\nFALSE\nfe_code_235\n439\n9.157280\n\n\nTRUE\nfe_code_210\n1903\n26.750070\n\n\nTRUE\nfe_code_211\n286\n4.020242\n\n\nTRUE\nfe_code_230_231\n636\n8.940118\n\n\nTRUE\nfe_code_233\n1797\n25.260051\n\n\nTRUE\nfe_code_234\n1890\n26.567332\n\n\nTRUE\nfe_code_235\n602\n8.462187\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also looked into whether there might be an overestimation of fuel tank capacity and storage capacity. It seems that, on average, it is the opposite of what we should expect. The simulation, in fact, is using less of both fuel and storage capacities, while vessels spend more time at sea and travel greater distances. This matches with the high number of no-catch trips.\n\n\n\n\n\nfuel_diff\nstorage_dif\ntimeatsea_diff\ntraveled_dist_diff\n\n\n\n\n-1837.643\n-3129.313\n12.98543\n457.3273\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the issue could be related to many vessels having less than 3 nodes of fishing grounds assigned (as suggested by Bastardie). However, as seen below, by checking the input file vesselsspe_fgrounds_quarter1.dat, we see that only two vessels have been assigned 3 or fewer nodes where they can fish.\n\n\n\n\n\nvids\ncount\n\n\n\n\nUSA0227\n3\n\n\nUSA0269\n3\n\n\nUSA0090\n5\n\n\nUSA0177\n5\n\n\nUSA0095\n10\n\n\nUSA0107\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2.3 Version 1.2.3\nThe latest version, 1.2.3, fixed the issue with the reason_back == 4. The problem was that all vessels received the order to return to port when changing quarters, even if some vessels were already in port, making the return unnecessary. Consequently, the next trip for those vessels in port would have been triggered with a return and zero catch (potentially long after each quarter’s tstep). New results showed improved fishing times and reduced trips with no catch.\n\nTotal cumulative fishing time from VMS-TIX: 270417.4.\nTotal cumulative fishing time from simulated trips: 134957.\n\n\nTotal landings from VMS-TIX: 30436950.\nTotal landings from simulated trips: 50237323.\n\n\nNumber of trips from VMS-TIX: 13784.\nNumber of simulated trips: 11612.\nTotal time at sea from VMS-TIX: 369500.1.\nTotal time at sea from simulation: 735591.\nTotal traveled distances from VMS-TIX: 2104922.\nTotal traveled distances from simulation: 8681803.\n\nWith this version, now reason_back == 4 only affects a small number of trips.

However, this approach does not account for variations in trip frequency by vessel type and gear. Ideally, we should define a scenario using the actual parameters that dictate vessel departure behavior, based on VMS-TIX data. This would involve setting fishing day restrictions according to the average fishing days by gear type and vessel length, derived from VMS-TIX data, and inputting them through the decision tree as detailed in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvesselSizeIs\n15-18m\n15-18m\n15-18m\n15-18m\n15-18m\n18-24m\n18-24m\n18-24m\n18-24m\n18-24m\nu15m\nu15m\nu15m\nu15m\nu15m\nu15m\n\n\nvesselMetierIs\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\nprobability\n0.03\n0.05\n0.05\n0.01\n0.02\n0.02\n0.01\n0.05\n0.00\n0.02\n0.07\n0.03\n0.04\n0.04\n0.04\n0.04\n\n\n\n\n\nThese probabilities were applied to version 5.0 within the DTree under todayIs WeekStart, with todayIs WeekEnding set to 0. However, the trips resulting from this simulation were significantly lower than actual counts, indicating further adjustments are needed.\n\nNumber of trips from VMS-TIX: 13784.\nNumber of simulated trips: 5359.\n\n\n\n\n\nWang, Yi-Hui, Benjamin I Ruttenberg, Ryan K Walter, Frank Pendleton, Jameal F Samhouri, Owen R Liu, and Crow White. 2024. “High Resolution Assessment of Commercial Fisheries Activity Along the US West Coast Using Vessel Monitoring System Data with a Case Study Using California Groundfish Fisheries.” Plos One 19 (6): e0298868."
